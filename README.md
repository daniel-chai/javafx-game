# JavaFX Game

JavaFX arcade-style shooting game created as an individual class project for CS 308

## How to Play

- You, as the player, are the green rectangle. The enemies are the red rectangles that come down from
the top of the screen. Move around with arrow keys and shoot lasers in any direcition with WASD to kill
the enemies. 
- There are 4 levels. Each level lasts 20 seconds. If you let an enemy reach the bottom of the screen, 
you lose. If you run into an enemy, you also lose. Surviving the 20 seconds lets you move on to the next 
level. Each level is progressively harder.
- The final level is the boss level. There is only one boss, who can also move around and shoot lasers.
You each have 5 lives, and if the boss runs out of lives before you do, you win. Purple potions also
periodically appear on the screen. Running into a purple potion will restore one of your lives.

## Cheat Codes

1. In the four normal levels, press SPACE to automatically win the level and move on to the next level.
2. In the boss level, press SPACE to decrease the enemy boss's lives by 1.
