## Impressions

This was a very rewarding assignment. It was a bit hard to get acquainted with JavaFX at first, but once 
that hurdle was passed, it was fun to work on this assignment. The most rewarding part was thinking
rigorously about the design, as I've never needed to think about code design so in depth before.
